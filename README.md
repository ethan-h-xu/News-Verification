# News-Verification

This is my proof of concept of news verification through traceable and immutable information by utilizing the AlgoRand blockchain. 
This project was created and pitched for the EasyA x Algorand hackathon hosted at Harvard University.

# Demonstration
## Example Social Media Feed

# Next Step
1. Focus on scalability with storing information on-chain
2. Utilize machine learning to detect sources and quotes when a quotation isn't used.
3. Develop an image database to check sources of images used too
